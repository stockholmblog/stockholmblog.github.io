Stockholm is a beautiful city. More so in the summers. Which is why, as a traveler, you may need constant internet access to post those pictures on Instagram. 

SIM cards in Sweden

* are relatively cheap
* do not need you to provide an ID when getting them
* are easily available in any sort of convinience store (PressbyrÃ¥n is everywhere and they have them)
* are not needed if you're from the EU, since other EU SIM Cards just work here

You can even get them at the airport (at the PressbyrÃ¥n) - which is why it is not recommended to buy one of those extremely expensive (and at times painful to use) international SIM cards. 

## Recommended Carriers
[Lycamobile](https://www.lycamobile.se/sv/bundles/) and [Comviq](https://www.comviq.se/kontantkort) are two very easy to find brands that you'll find in any convinience store and have cheap plans and have a good 4G coverage all over the city and other parts of Sweden. 

Some store just have these lying outside their doors and you can just pick one up and activate it. 

Some packs cost as low as 50 SEK, and give you unlimited local calling and ~4GB of 4G surfing. Some plans also give you ~100 mins of international calling. They can be recharged in their respective apps and also at convinience stores (usually, the small ones, and not the large supermarkets like Coop).

## Outside of Stockholm
If you plan to go into the wilderness or far up north, Telia (or a provider that uses the Telia network like Halebop and Fello) is highly recommended. This can be seen from [their coverage map](https://www.telia.se/privat/support/tackningskartor):

## E-SIM
Lycamobile doesn't support e-sim but Telia and Comviq do.

## Long-term Stay
The above information is only useful for short term travelers, of course. If you want to optimise your monthly bill over a longer period, this tweet basically sums it up:
