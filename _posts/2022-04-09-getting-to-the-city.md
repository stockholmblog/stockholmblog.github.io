At the center of the city is Stockholms Centralstation. This is the easiest [1] point to start if you want to get to any other part of the city. Most trains into Stockholm will drop you at one of the platforms of Central Station. Even if you’re landing at one of the three airports around Stockholm, this is where you’d want to get to next, especially if you’re here for the first time.
## Three airports?
The one true Stockholm airport is the Stockholm Arlanda airport (ARN). But you may find yourself at one of the other two, Skavsta or Västerås. If you’re still booking your flight tickets, prefer Arlanda. The rest may be called Stockholm’s airports, but they’re pretty far out. 
## Arlanda airport to Stockholms Centralstation
There are several ways of getting from the airport to the city and you can choose your pick, depending on the time you have and money you want to shell out.
### Taxi
Probably the most straightforward way to get from the airport to any point anywhere. But you knew that already. The [Stockholm Taxi]( https://www.taxistockholm.se/en/) taxis can cost around 500 SEK. Uber and Bolt are the two app-based services that work well as well.
### Arlanda Express
The [Arlanda express train]( https://www.arlandaexpress.com/tickets/tickets-prices) is a fast, pretty and very yellow train. It is the fastest way (18 minutes) to get to the city and costs around 300 SEK for one person. Around 200 SEK per head if you’re two. They’re nice about group discounts and list them on their very yellow website.
### Pendeltåg
A cheaper alternative is to take a Pendeltåg (commuter rail) from the Arlanda station to the city. A standard Stockholm metro ticket works on this train, however you must pay 130 SEK as a [passage fee]( https://www.swedavia.com/arlanda/train/) from and into the Arlanda station, apart from the metro ticket price. The advantage of taking this is that if your destination falls on the way to the city, this is very convenient. Also, the metro ticket is valid for 75 minutes, so you can use the same ticket to get on a metro, train, bus or a boat for your onward journey.
### Flyggbus
Or, the [airport coach]( https://www.flygbussarna.se/priser). This costs you ~120 SEK on the app and is cheaper when you want to go to and fro. This is obviously slower than the options before it.
### SL Bus
The cheapest and the least convenient option can get you to the city in one metro ticket, or 38 SEK. Take an SL [2] bus from outside the airport to the Märsta station. Then climb on to one of the Pendeltågs heading from the station to the city on the same ticket. You don’t need to pay the Arlanda passage fee here. 

[1] It is however, not the easiest place to navigate. We will cover that in a future article.
