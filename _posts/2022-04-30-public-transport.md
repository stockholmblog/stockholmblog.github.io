As you'd expect from any major European city, Stockholm has excellent public transport. If you're moving around within the city, you can take one or more of the following means of transport provided by the SL (Storstockholms Lokaltrafik) company:

1. Bus
2. Metro
3. Commuter Rail
4. Boats
5. Trams

These can usually be identified by this logo:

## Paying for SL
You can pay for public transport using any of the following means:

### SL Card (SL-Kort)
The latest edition of SL card is green in color and looks like this:

This can be recharged from the app or at any of the SL counters at the metro stations. You may also see some blue SL cards but those are soon to be deprecated. The SL card has no real advantage over the SL app unless you want to keep your public transport access separate from your phone.

### SL App
The SL app can be downloaded on an [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sl.SLBiljetter&hl=en&gl=US) and an [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/sl-reseplanerare-och-biljetter/id918418291) device and is the best way to plan your journey. You can also purchase one or more SL tickets on your phone here. 

### Paying directly
You can tap your debit or credit contactless card at one of the terminals on any SL mode of transport and it's going to work the same as any of the two above. One tap gets you a valid 75 minute ticket from the moment of tapping. This is the best option if you don't need longer tickets since this works with Google, Apple, Garmin and Fitbit Pay.

## Ticket Types

The basic ticket costs SEK 38 and lasts 75 minutes. This means, you can take a train, get off at a station, take a bus to the ferry terminal, take a boat to a tram terminal and so on within 75 minutes on the same ticket. A phone ticket is destroyed after every 75 minutes, but if you're using an SL card or a debit/credit card, multiple taps within the 75 minute period doesn't cost you anything.

However, if you're going to be around for longer, you may choose one of the following passes.  

* 24 hours: SEK 165 (adult fare); SEK 110 (discounted fare)
* 72 hours: SEK 330 (adult fare); SEK 220 (discounted fare)
* 7 days: SEK 430 (adult fare); SEK 290 (discounted fare)
* 30 days: SEK 970 (adult fare); SEK 650 (discounted fare)
* 90 days: SEK 2810 (adult fare); SEK 1880 (discounted fare)
* 1 year: SEK 10190 (adult fare); SEK 6830 (discounted fare)

> As of writing this article, these passes don't work on your debit/credit card and the only way to get them is on your SL card or your phone app.

> You pay adult fare if you are between 20 and 64 years old. You pay the discounted fare if you are over 65 years of age, a student holding a Swedish student identity card with the SL logotype, or if you are under 20 years of age.
