A personnummer is a unique personal identity number assigned to every individual living in Sweden. It is used for various official purposes such as tax identification, social security, and healthcare. The number is made up of 10 digits, with the first 6 digits representing the individual's date of birth, and the last 4 digits being a unique serial number. Personnummer are issued by the Swedish Tax Agency (Skatteverket) and are used as a primary means of identification in Sweden.

## How to get one?
To get a personnummer in Sweden, you will need to register with the Swedish Tax Agency (Skatteverket) and provide them with the necessary documentation. The process is typically as follows:

1. Gather the required documents: You will need to provide original copies of your passport or other valid identification, proof of address in Sweden, and any other documents required by Skatteverket.
2. Register in person: You will need to visit a Skatteverket office in person to register and submit your documents. You can find the nearest office on the Skatteverket website.
3. Wait for processing: Skatteverket will process your application and issue a personnummer within a few weeks. You will receive your number in the mail.

Please note that the process may vary depending on your circumstances and the immigration status in Sweden. It is always recommended to check the Skatteverket website for the most updated information and instructions.

If you're relocating to Sweden, this is probably the first thing you should do, since actually getting the personnummer might take a few weeks.

## ID Card (ID-Kort)
After getting a personnummer, it's recommended to get an ID card, which serves as a definitive proof of identity in Sweden.  

## Bank ID
BankID is a digital identification system used in Sweden to confirm the identity of individuals when accessing online services such as banking, government services, and other private services. It is issued by various banks in the country and is based on the personnummer that each individual is assigned. By using BankID, users can access online services without the need to memorize multiple usernames and passwords, and service providers can verify the identity of users with a high level of confidence. It is widely used in Sweden and is considered to be one of the most secure and efficient digital identification systems in the world.
